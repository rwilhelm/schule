	This file explains how to get started in Mystic Pascal and
how to run the TUTOR program.

1. Make a backup copy of the entire Mystic Pascal distribution disk.
Never use the distribution disk to run Pascal.

2. If you are using a non-standard video adapter, you must run the
MYSTICIN installation program first.  The distribution version of
Mystic Pascal is setup to run on a standard IBM PC with either a
color card or monochrome card or both.  MYSTICIN may also be used
to modify screen colors and video snow suppression.

3. To start Mystic, you need the files MYSTIC.EXE and MYSTIC.LIB.
Type:

	MYSTIC

4. You are now in the Editor screen.  Now load the TUTOR.PAS program.
Type:
	F2		(Function Key 2)
	L
	TUTOR.PAS

5. Mystic Pascal has four screens that you can use.  Type F1 to see
the Screen Selection menu.

	F1	Editor
	F2	Direct Mode
	F3	System Display
	F4	Laser Display

6. Go to the System Display screen by typing F1 to bring up the menu
and then F3 to select System Display.  This screen is updated once
per second.  It shows a memory map and a table of the multi-tasking
processes now running.

7. Now go back to the Editor to compile the TUTOR program.  Type
F1 then F1 to reach the Editor screen.

8. To compile a program, type F2 then C.  If any errors are detected
the error message will be displayed on the Editor screen and the 
cursor positioned at the point the error was first detected.

9. To run the TUTOR program, go to the Direct Mode screen (F1-F2).
The backslash is the prompt character.  To run a main program in
Direct Mode, just type the name of the program (as declared after
the PROGRAM reserved word).
Type:
	TUTOR

10. You can work through the several lessons of TUTOR to become
more familiar with Mystic Pascal and Direct Mode programming in
particular.

11. To terminate Mystic Pascal and return to DOS, type:

	F1
	Ctrl-End
