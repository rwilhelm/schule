        10.  Mysticin Installation Program

             The installation program is used to modify the Mystic Pascal 
        system  to  match  your particular computer  system  and  program 
        needs.   The characteristics of your video display are the  major 
        factors  to be adjusted.   When Mystic Pascal starts up,  it will 
        detect  if  a monochrome or color video adapter  is  present  and 
        behave appropriately.   If you have another type of adapter, such 
        as,  an  Enhanced  Graphics Adapter,  you must run  the  Mysticin 
        program before using Mystic.

             To run the installation program, enter:

             MYSTICIN

             The  program  is  self-explanatory and will prompt  for  all 
        required   information.    Various  parameters  determining   the 
        configuration of storage in Mystic Pascal may also be modified.
